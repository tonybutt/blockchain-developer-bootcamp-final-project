# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
1. Create a smart contract that takes in a commit hash for a project  
2. The Smart contracts committee votes whether to approve the application
3. Upon approval, the smart contract issues an NFT to the developer allowing them the permission to deploy that code at that commit hash to run in the environment
4. Additionally, upon receipt of the commit hash, the code repo, a code scanning service provides scan data of the code to the smart contract
